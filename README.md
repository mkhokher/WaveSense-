**WaveSense – WiFi CSI Based Gesture Recognition**

WaveSense is a device-free, privacy-preserving, and non-intrusive Human Activity & Gesture Recognition system built using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI).
This repository contains the complete machine learning pipeline for preprocessing CSI data, feature engineering, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and visualization.

*Features*

1.End-to-end CSI preprocessing and cleaning

2. Automatic handling of missing, noisy, and non-numeric data

3. Multi-class One-vs-Rest classification
   
4.Implements Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression

5.GridSearchCV for best model selection

6.PCA & KernelPCA-based 2D visualization

7.Confusion matrices, classification reports, ROC curves

8.KMeans clustering with gesture mapping
